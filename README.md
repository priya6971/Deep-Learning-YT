# Deep-Learning-YT
This repository contains all the notes, code files, and relevant resources from the Deep Learning playlist published on my YouTube channel. Each folder or notebook aligns with a specific video in the series, covering core deep learning concepts, practical model building, and real-world applications using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

What's Inside:
âœ… Well-commented Jupyter notebooks
âœ… Step-by-step implementations of deep learning models
âœ… Lecture notes and explanations in simple terms
âœ… Links to each corresponding YouTube video
